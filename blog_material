Since ember has handlebars as dependency, handlebars must be loaded first. Try to swap the order in wich you are loading, e.g.
1. jquery
2. handlebars
3. ember
in this order there is no problem.


When /tasks is visited, Ember calls the App.TasksRoute object, which then finds the list of tasks, and assigns it to App.TasksController.
Controllers rarely make calls to get data. 



--------

In computed properties: if you assign another calculated variable inside the computed property function, they do not automatically listen
to the changes to the model (only initiated once unless you put it into the same statement as the "return" to force it to reinit the object.


  isDelayed: function() {
    var today = new Date();
    var start_date = new Date(this.get('start_date'));
    var end_date = new Date(this.get('end_date'));
    return start_date < today && end_date > today && this.get('task_status') == 0
  }.property('start_date', 'end_date', 'task_status'),

  isDelayed: function() {
    var today = new Date();
    return (new Date(this.get('start_date'))) < today && (new Date(this.get('end_date'))) > today && this.get('task_status') == 0
  }.property('start_date', 'end_date', 'task_status'),
