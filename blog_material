Since ember has handlebars as dependency, handlebars must be loaded first. Try to swap the order in wich you are loading, e.g.
1. jquery
2. handlebars
3. ember
in this order there is no problem.


When /tasks is visited, Ember calls the App.TasksRoute object, which then finds the list of tasks, and assigns it to App.TasksController.
Controllers rarely make calls to get data.
